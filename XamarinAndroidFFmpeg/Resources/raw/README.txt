The FFmpeg version 3.4 downloaded from 
https://www.johnvansickle.com/ffmpeg/
for armel processors

Welcome! These static builds of FFmpeg for Linux (kernels 2.6.32+) are the easiest way to get the latest version running on your server or workstation. Each archive includes ffmpeg, ffmpeg-10bit, ffprobe, ffserver, qt-faststart, and all the man pages in both text and pdf format. Just unpack and run ./ffmpeg

Please note it's highly recommended to use git builds, because bug fixes and other improvements are added on a daily basis.
All static builds available here are licensed under the GNU General Public License version 3. If you appreciate this up-to-date build of FFmpeg and my time that goes into to maintaining it, please consider making a donation. Thank you.
